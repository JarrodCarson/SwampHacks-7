## Inspiration

We were inspired by challenging Flash games of old, such as Cat Mario and Unfair Platformer. No game is more retro than Pong, so we decided to combine it with the soul-crushing difficulty of these Flash games!

## What it does

***Unfair Pong*** starts out like a regular game of Pong. However, it quickly becomes very difficult. Every so often, an event will trigger that will alter gameplay. These events range from easy to hard, across three difficulty levels. Events include, but are not limited to, swapping control between paddles, and a fake advertisement that the player must click away.

***Unfair Pong*** is like a permadeath roguelike! Once you miss a shot, it's game over! Your score is based on how long you survive.

## How we built it

We decided to build ***Unfair Pong*** in React. Luckily for us, there already existed an [open-source Pong project in React](https://github.com/ohall/react-pong), which we used as a starting point. From there, we made visual adjustments, added our game events, and implemented a high score database.

We used Firebase to host the game and store a database. The game is up and running for you to try out [here](unfairpong.web.app)!

## Challenges we ran into

Three out of our four team members had little to no prior experience with React, Node, or JavaScript. Learning these new technologies was taxing, but we managed to take advantage of them. Liam, our team leader, has past experience with them, and he guided us along the way. (P.S. - Thanks for that React workshop, Swamphacks organizers!)

We wanted to use our free domain from Domains.com, but Firebase had trouble verifying that we own it. The data is likely taking its time trying to propagate, so this was not something we were able to complete during the hackathon.

Another challenge we encountered was that the open-source Pong code we used was outdated, and outdated by around 7 years! Much of React has changed since its creation, so creating something using deprecated functions was difficult (it even confused the mentors!).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

*Boing?*

We are proud of accomplishing so much of the project this weekend, in spite of the challenges we faced. We were able to implement nearly everything we wanted to.

We are also proud of creating something that can thoroughly annoy the player!

## What we learned

We learned how to use React/Node/JS, deploy with Firebase, purchase a domain name, and modify open-source code.

## What's next for *Unfair Pong*

We would like to add many more events, such as changing the orientation to vertical, rotating the paddle upon bouncing, and spawning fixed paddles in the center of the screen.

We want to improve the visuals and graphics--perhaps making the game truly 3D (as an event).

Additionally, we would like to get the game hosted on the free domain we acquired, UnfairPong.space.
